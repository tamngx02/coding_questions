Find the nth number of Fibonnacci sequence

The simple method
  Using recursive based on Fibonnacci 
  F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)
  
The faster method
  Treat the sequence as a list of number
  Calculate the arr most ended number and append based on the formula F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)
  However, we only care about the (n-1)th and (n-2)th to print the nth(required) number.
  Therefore, there will be no repetition as the recursive method.
